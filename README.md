# Python ft232_cbus_config

Python script to configure FT232 CBUS pins. Requires python-ftdi1.

Inspired by: https://github.com/trabucayre/ft232_cbus_config

By default CBUS2 and CBUS3 are configured in IOMODE while CBUS0 and CBUS1 are
left at their default (TXLED/RXLED). Edit the script to change the default
settings.
